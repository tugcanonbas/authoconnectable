# AuthoConnectable Template

A template to create a new Vapor project with ease of Authomatek and ConnectableKit packages!

## Features

- Pre-configured with Authomatek and ConnectableKit packages
  - That mean you can directly use Authentication with the structured JSON response
- Pre-configured `ServerConfiguration` for the API
  - Server status info logs for environment that is using.
  - Settting for the hostname and port.
  - `ConnectableKit` configurations
    - `ConnectableErrorMiddleware` and `ConnectableCORSMiddleware` are pre-configured
  - Default `FileMiddleware` for public directory
  - Use `.leaf` if you did choose to use Leaf as the template engine
  - `Authomatek` configurations
    - Custom `RouteConfig` for the versioning
    - `AuthoConnectable` controller to use `Connectable` protocol for the `AuthoController`
  - Database configurations (Just for SQL databases)
    - Can be choose between `PostgreSQL`, `MySQL` (Because I tested it with these two only üò¨)
    - Migrations for the Profile model and it's DTO's like `Create`, `Login`, `Update` and `List` (UserModel and UserStatus added by `Authomatek`)
    - Auto migration and wait for the database to be ready
  - Route configurations
    - Default max body size is 10MB
    - `WEBRouter` for the web routes if you did choose to use Leaf as the template engine
    - `APIRouter` for all routes
      - Pre-configured versioning routes for the `ProfileRouter` (Authentication routes added by `Authomatek`)
    - `ProfileRouter` for the GET all, `GET` by `:profileID`, `POST`, `PUT` and `PUT` routes
      - `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE` is protected by `AuthoMiddleware`
  - Pre-configured `Constant`s and `Endpoint`s
    - `Constant` for the `Server` and `Database` related
    - `Endpoint` for the route and versioning related

## Installation

### - Using Vapor CLI

- It's easy to create a new project with this template using Vapor CLI (toolbox) like creating a new project with the default template.

```bash
vapor new {{project_name}} --template https://github.com/tugcanonbas/authoconnectable.git
```

- The process is the same with the default template with minimum adjustments for `Authomatek` package. Just follow the steps and you are good to go!

  - It will not ask you to use fluent,

  ```bash
  Would you like to use Fluent? (--fluent/--no-fluent)
  ```

  because fluent is a must for `Authomatek` package.

  - It will ask you to choose the database type, choose one of the following (Because I tested it with these two only üò¨):

    - `PostgreSQL`
    - `MySQL`

  - It will ask you to use Leaf as the template engine.

## Environment Variables

- You need to set the environment variables:
  - for the database connection.
  - for the JWT secret key.
  - for the JWT access and refresh expiration time.
